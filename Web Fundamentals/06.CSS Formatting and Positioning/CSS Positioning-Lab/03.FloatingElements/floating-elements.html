        The float CSS property specifies that an element should be
        taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right
        side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap
        around it.

        Without floating, the inline-block elements float like words
        in a text and block elements just do not float and stay in
        a vertical block of full width.
